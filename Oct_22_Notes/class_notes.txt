Normalization is scientific method of breaking down the complex table structures into simple table structures by using certain rules. 

There are various normal forms as 

Employ(Empno,Name,Gender,Salary,DeptCode,DeptHead,ProjCode,Hours) 

    E101,Ajay,MALE,88234,D124,Saketh,{P124,P522,P311},{882,55,114}

1) First Normal Form : A table said to be in 1NF, when each cell contains precisely One value (Atomic Values) 

By Applying 1NF 

    E101,Ajay,MALE,88234,D124,Saketh,P124,882
    E101,Ajay,MALE,88234,D124,Saketh,P522,55
    E101,Ajay,MALE,88234,D124,Saketh,P311,114

Insert : The ProjCode and Hours will not be available to employee at the time of entering employee records. 

Update : DeptCode,DeptHead are repeated multiple times, if DeptHead moves to another dept, then the change needs to be reflected to all corresponding records. 

Delete : If any employee record deleted, then the corresponding project records also deleted. 

1NF inadequate 

2) Second Normal Form : A table said to be in 2NF, at first it must be in 1NF, every attribute functionally depend on whole key but not part of the key. {Functional Dependency} 

Guidelines : 

	-> Find and remove attributes that are not functionally depend on 
		whole key
	-> Group the remaining attributes. 

Employ(Empno,Name,Gender,Salary,DeptCode,DeptHead,ProjCode,Hours) 

	Empno ->  Name (Yes)
	      ->  Gender (Yes)
	      ->  Salary (Yes)
	      ->  DeptCode (Yes)
	      ->  DeptHead (Yes)
	      ->  ProjCode (No)
	      ->  Hours (No) 

Employ(empno+,name,gender,salary,deptcode,depthead)
Project(Projcode,Empno-,Hours) 
	{ProjCode+Empno}

Insert : DeptCode and DeptHead details not available till employee is there. 

Update : DeptCode,DeptHead repeated several times as if any head moves to another dept change to be happen manually.

Delete : If any employee records deletes then the depthead data also lost. 

So 2NF inadequate 

3) Third Normal Form : A table said to be in 3NF, at first it must be in 2NF each attribute needs to depend on whole key but not transitively. (Transitive Dependency)

Guidelines : 
	=> Find and remove attributes that are transitively depend on whole key
	=> Group the remaining attributes

By applying 3NF 


	
Employ(empno+,name,gender,salary,deptcode,depthead)

Empno -> Name (Yes)
      -> Gender (Yes)
      -> Salary (Yes)  
      -> DeptCode (No)
      -> DeptHead (No)

Department(DeptCode+,DeptHead)
Employ(Empno+,Name,Gender,Salary,DeptCode-)
Project(Projcode,Empno-,Hours) 
	{ProjCode+Empno}

EmployeeDetails(EmpId,Name,Gender,Doj,LeaveAvailable,LeaveId,LeaveStartDate,LeaveEndDate,NoOfDays,LossOfPay,LeaveReason,LeaveStatus,ManagerComments)

First Normal Form : A table said to be 1NF each cell contains precisely one value (Atomic) 

Insert : Not able to enter Leave Details in employee registration part

Update : No Issue

Delete : No issue 

1NF inadqudate 

2nf : Functional Depedency 


EmployeeDetails(EmpId,Name,Gender,Doj,LeaveAvailable,LeaveId,LeaveStartDate,LeaveEndDate,NoOfDays,LossOfPay,LeaveReason,LeaveStatus,ManagerComments)

EmpId -> Name (Yes)
	 Gender (Yes)
	 Doj (Yes)
	 LeaveAvailable (Yes)
	 LeaveId (No)
	 LeaveStartDate(No)
	 LeaveEndDate(no)
	 NoOfDays (No)
	 LeaveReason(No)
	 LeaveStatus(No)
	 ManagerComments(No)

Employee(EmpId+,Name,Gender,Doj)
LeaveDetails(LeaveId+,EmpId-,LeaveStartDate,LeaveEndDate,NoOfDays,LeaveReason,
LeaveStatus,ManagerComments)
